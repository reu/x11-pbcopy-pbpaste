# xcopy

Made because I miss OSX's pbcopy/pbpaste and also because I couldn't get a grip on xclip's UX.

## Usage

```bash
$ echo "lolwut" | xcopy
$ xpaste
lolwut
```

## Installation

Check out the releases page for prebuilt versions.

## TODO

This could totally be made multiplatform, but for now it is Linux only.
